A prediction method by fusing RNA sequence and structure information to identify small molecule-RNA binding sites. 
The  codes for PCN_RNAsite and an example from dataset CS71 are available in ./src. And the demo and corresponding documentation files can be found in ./demo. See our paper for more details.


Requirements
python 3.8.8
numpy 1.23.5
scikit-learn 1.2.2
pandas 3.1.0

Testing each RNA takes approximately 10 seconds

Test the model on TE18 (~3min)
cd ./predict/
python predict_TE18.py  

Test the model on RB9 (~3min)
cd ./predict/
python predict_RB9.py
