A prediction method by fusing RNA sequence and structure information to identify small molecule-RNA binding sites. 
The data and the labels in this study are available in ./data. The codes for CNRBind are available in ./src. And the demo and corresponding documentation files can be found in ./demo. See our paper for more details.

Testing each RNA takes approximately 10 seconds, depending on the sequence length

Test the model on TE18 (~3min)
cd ./predict/
python predict_TE18.py  

Test the model on RB9 (~3min)
cd ./predict/
python predict_RB9.py
