A prediction method by fusing RNA sequence and structure information to identify small molecule-RNA binding sites. 
Testing each RNA takes approximately 20 seconds
Test the model on TE18 (~6min)
cd ./predict/
python predict_TE18.py  

Test the model on RB9 (~3min)
cd ./predict/
python predict_RB9.py
